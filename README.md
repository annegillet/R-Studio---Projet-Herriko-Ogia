# Herriko Ogia Project

This project answers to one main issue: How can the Herroki Ogia cooperative collect datas from its bakers and develop its prospecting ? 

> On one hand, I decided to create a form that can be modified according to the future needs of the cooperative. Formulas can be added too.

> On the other hand, once datas are registered, you can download them and upload it in an other tab. Then, a graph will show you the quantity of flour used by each baker.

> Finally, an interactive map will facilitate the visualisation of the flour production per town.
